        </div>
        <span>Many adult students wish to be fluent when they communicate in English, whether in a social setting or in the workplace. I always believe, and stress to my students, that confidence and not being shy in making mistakes are important qualities to have in learning a new language. Confidence is something that I can help the student with, by providing the right guidance and tools. Not being shy is something which the student herself has to overcome. Of course, I always try to make it as comfortable as possible for my students to speak out.</span>
